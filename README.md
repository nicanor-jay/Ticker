## Background
Ticker is an app I decided to build to help me learn about proper clean architecture in android app development.
Through building Ticker, I focused on implementing clean architecture patterns to achieve separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability.

This project served as a hands-on learning opportunity, allowing me to explore domain layers, data layers, and presentation layers in depth.
